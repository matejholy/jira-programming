My name is Matej Hol√Ω and I'm a software developer working at [ARBES Technologies](http://arbes.com) in Czech Republic.

We've started using [JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) with [Tempo Timesheets](http://tempo.io/) and needed to create plugins, reports and [ScriptRunner](http://www.adaptavist.com/w/products-plugins/adaptavist-scriptrunner/scriptrunner-for-jira/) scripts to suit our needs. I would like to share the things I have learned in hope they will be useful to others.

### Contact me

If you have any questions, send me an e-mail. I will help if I can.
