Today, instead of giving a tip about programming, I am offering to help with anything related to programming for Jira.

I'm curious if I will be able to help someone outside my regular job.

So if you have any questions, need to point to a possible solution or just want to talk about a problem you're currently solving, send me an e-mail at [holymatej@gmail.com](mailto:holymatej@gmail.com).

Looking forward to hearing from you!
