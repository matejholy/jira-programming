Do you want to develop your own plugin for Jira and don't know where to start?

Or just want to write a script for Scriptrunner?

Or maybe you are stuck on how to solve a particular Jira problem?

Let me know what you need or are struggling with and I'll be happy to help, if I can.

Just send me an e-mail at [holymatej@gmail.com](mailto:holymatej@gmail.com).

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Matej
