# JIRA Programming

I'm a software developer working at [ARBES Technologies](http://arbes.com) in Czech Republic.

We've started using [JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) with [Tempo Timesheets](http://tempo.io/) and needed to create plugins, reports and [ScriptRunner](http://www.adaptavist.com/w/products-plugins/adaptavist-scriptrunner/scriptrunner-for-jira) scripts to suit our needs.

I would like to share the things I have learned in hope they will be useful to others.
